		 through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based
		 on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.<br>
         Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is
		 difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.<br>

         Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. 
		 The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.
		 Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. In its application
		 across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.<br>

         <b><u>Simple Definition:</u></b> Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability 
		 to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development 
		 of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.</p>

	       <hr style="margin-right:20px;">
		   
		   <p>Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so.
		     It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks assigned to computers, 
			 it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the 
			 computer's part, no learning is needed. For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed 
			 algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having 
			 human programmers specify every needed step.
		   <br>
		   <br>
			Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the "signal" 
		     or "feedback" available to the learning system:

             <ul>
			     <li><b style="color:red;"><u>Supervised learning:</u></b> The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", 
				 and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.</li>
                 <li><b style="color:red;"><u>Unsupervised learning:</u></b> No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure 
				 in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards
				 an end (feature learning).</li>
                 <li><b style="color:red;"><u>Reinforcement learning:</u></b> A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a 
				 certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space,
				 the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.</li>
				 </ul><br>
                Other approaches have been developed which don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorization, and sometimes more 
				 than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example topic modeling, dimensionality reduction or meta learning.<br>

                 As of 2020, deep learning has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning.</p>

           <h3>Re-surging interest in machine learning is due to the same factors that have made data mining and Bayesian
		     analysis more popular than ever. Things like growing volumes and varieties of available data, computational processing
			 that is cheaper and more powerful, and affordable data storage</h3>

             <p style="font-size:18px;">All of these things mean it's possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can
			 analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results – even on a very large scale. And by building 
			 precise models, an organization has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – or avoiding unknown risks.
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 Because of new computing technologies, machine learning today is not like machine learning of the past. It was born from pattern 
			 recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks; researchers interested in
			 artificial intelligence wanted to see if computers could learn from data. The iterative aspect of machine learning is important 
			 because as models are exposed to new data, they are able to independently adapt. They learn from previous computations to produce 
			 reliable, repeatable decisions and results. It’s a science that’s not new – but one that has gained fresh momentum.</p>

		     <h3>While many machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability to automatically apply complex
			     mathematical calculations to big data – over and over, faster and faster – is a recent development. Here are a few widely 
				 publicized examples of machine learning applications you may be familiar with:</h3>

                 <li>Online recommendation offers such as those from Amazon and Netflix? Machine learning applications for everyday life.</li>

		     <h3>Applications</h3>
			 <hr>
			 <ul style="font-size:18px;">
			     <li><b style="color:navy;"><u>Web Search Engine:</u></b> One of the reasons why search engines like google, bing etc work 
				     so well is because the system has learnt how to rank pages through a complex learning algorithm.</li>
				 <li><b style="color:navy;"><u>Photo tagging Applications:</u></b> Be it facebook or any other photo tagging application, 
				     the ability to tag friends makes it even more happening. It is all possible because of a face recognition algorithm 
					 that runs behind the application.</li> 
                 <li><b style="color:navy;"><u>Spam Detector:</u></b> Our mail agent like Gmail or Hotmail does a lot of hard work for us in classifying
				     the mails and moving the spam mails to spam folder. This is again achieved by a spam classifier running in the back end of mail 
					 application.</li>	 					 
			 </ul>
			 <h3 style="margin-bottom:100px;">Today, companies are using Machine Learning to improve business decisions,increase productivity, detect disease, 
			     forecast weather, and do many more things. With the exponential growth of technology, we not only need better tools to 
				 understand the data we currently have, but we also need to prepare ourselves for the data we will have. To achieve this goal
				 we need to build intelligent machines. We can write a program to do simple things. But for most of times Hardwiring Intelligence 
				 in it is difficult. Best way to do it is to have some way for machines to learn things themselves. A mechanism for learning – 
				 if a machine can learn from input then it does the hard work for us.</h3>
