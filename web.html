   <p><b style="color:blue; font-size:20px;"> Web Development</b> is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
         (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), 
		 electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, 
		 may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security 
		 configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

      <p>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.
    	 Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>

      <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods
    	 like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer,
		 or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a
		 collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. <b style="color:red;">There are three kinds of Web 
		 developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.</b> Front-end developers are responsible for behavior
		 and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>

	<h2 style="color: darkorange">As an Industry</h2>
	<hr style="margin-right:20px;">
	  <p>Since the commercialization of the Web, Web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses 
	     wishing to use their Web site to advertise and sell products and services to customers.
         There are many<b style="color:blue;"> open source tools for Web development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
		 stack and Perl/Plack.</b> This has kept the cost of learning Web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the 
		 industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG Web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio.
		 Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned 
		 and implemented quickly.</p>

      <p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive Web sites. Further, Web developers now 
	     help to deliver applications as Web services which were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed
		 for many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe
		 Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive. These Web services allow users to interact with applications from many locations, instead of being tied
		 to a specific workstation for their application environment.</p>

      <p>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by Web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay 
	     have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have
		 transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers. Another example of transformative communication led by Web development
		 is the blog. Web applications such as WordPress and Movable Type have created blog-environments for individual Web sites. The increased usage of
		 open-source content management systems and enterprise content management systems has extended Web development's impact at online interaction and 
		 communication.</p>

	<h3 style="color:black;">Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. The websites we browse, the gifts we order and the news we peruse online are all made possible by the web
    	developers who design, build and implement Internet websites. They are heavily involved in website creation, from helping design aesthetic properties such as layout
		and color, to technical considerations such as how to design a website to handle a given amount of Internet traffic.</h3>

     <p style="color:red; font-size:15px;">Not only is the web development field exciting and on the forefront of the digital age, but it’s also a growing field. This guide will explain how to become a 
	     web developer, what skills and education are needed, different career paths, current market trends, and what people can expect as a web developer professional.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-7" style="margin-top:20px;">
	 <h2>Web Development Basics</h2>
	 <p style="color:navy; font-size:15px;">Web developers are responsible for designing and developing websites and website applications. Using a lot of programming languages and web technologies, web developers 
       	 manage site functionality, implement application features, and integrate security measures.</p>
	  
	  <br>
	  
	  <h2>Web Development In-Depth</h2>
	  <p style="color:navy; font-size:15px;">Web developers have expertise in object-oriented programming, multi-platform development, and the building of web applications.
	     They blend creative vision with project management skills to plan, design and build websites and integrated applications. Because of the complex nature of websites,
		  developers traditionally specialize in one of two tracks:<b style="color:red;"> front-end or back-end development.</b></p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	</div>
	

	<h4 style="margin-top:40px;">Front-end developers (also known as client-side development) use a variety of programming languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS 
	      and JavaScript to build the exterior look and features of a site. Back-end developers use programming languages such as Python and Ruby to design, build and 
		  integrate applications from front-end development into the back end—in other words, they make the features on the site operate. Individuals with skills in both 
		  front-end and back-end development are known as “full-stack developers.”</h4>
		  
	<br>
   <h2 style="color:navy;">STEPS TO BECOME A WEB DEVELOPER</h2>
    <hr style="margin-right:100px; color:navy;">    
	<p style="font-size:15px;">Web development is a flexible professional field, one that affords prospective students multiple ways to gain the training 
	  and experience necessary to begin their careers. Below is an overview of steps interested individuals can take to enter this career field.</p>
	  
	
	  <h3><b style="background-color:mediumseagreen; width:20px;"> 1.</b> Choose a development specialization</h3>
	   <p style="font-size:15px; margin:20px;">Each element of a website is linked to something else, and it’s a complex job to build a website successfully. Depending on their
	     specific jobs, web developers will be proficient in using various software programs (e.g. JavaScript frameworks, version control, CSS), and will have not
		 only the specialized knowledge that characterizes their roles, but also an understanding of the process as a whole. Prior to starting out, it’s wise to get an
		 understanding of the type of web development work that seems interesting—such as <b style="color:red;">user interface design, mobile application development, or 
		 front-end development </b>to best set the stage for future education and training.</p>
	<br>
	
	 <h3><b style="background-color:mediumseagreen; width:20px;"> 2.</b> Get an education</h3>
	 <p style="font-size:15px; margin:20px;">No specific degree or educational path exists for careers in web development, and it’s possible to become a web developer
	     with or without a formal education. While it’s certainly possible to <b style="color:red;">learn coding languages independently, there is more to web development than coding.</b> 
		 Individuals who can implement coding skills within a broader context may have an advantage, and that’s where a formal education can help prospective developers 
		 gain foundational knowledge of web development principles and practices, expose them to project management and situations that require problem-solving, and 
		 encourage critical thinking.</p>
		 
		 <p style = "font-size:15px; margin:20px;">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an associate degree is the most common minimum educational requirement
		     for employment. However, Robert Half Technology notes that a bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field is traditionally necessary for career 
			 advancement. More recently, coding boot camps such as Code Academy and App Academy have emerged as short-term, intensive training options for students
			 to gain career-specific coding skills that can boost their chances for employment.</p>
	<br>

       <h3><b style="background-color:mediumseagreen; width:20px;"> 3.</b> Develop technical skills</h3>	
	   <p style="font-size:15px; margin:20px;">Despite the real advantages that come with an organized education, web development is still a field in which concrete
	      skills can trump education when it comes to employment opportunities. Companies want employees who can produce, and how or where something was learned is secondary
		  to simply being able to do it.<b style="color:red;"> Prospective web developers should have expertise in the three core programming components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
		  They should also learn about CSS and CSS frameworks such as Backbone, Bootstrap, and Foundation.</b> Finally, to build applications,<i style="color:red;"> developers
		  should be proficient in back-end languages such as Ruby, Java, PHP and tools such as Oracle and SQL Server.</i>
		  
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

        <h3><b style="background-color:mediumseagreen; width:20px;"> 4.</b> Practice your coding skills</h3>	
		<p style="font-size:15px; margin:20px;">Web developers learn by doing.<b style="color:red;"> Set up a Github account and push code to the site.
       		  An active Github profile can get the attention of employers</b> searching through stacks of resumes, and demonstrates not only what a candidate does to 
			  solve programming issues, but also the thinking and strategies behind those solutions. Practicing coding and getting used to using Git prepares developers to
			  work as part of a team, as well as manage complicated site and application builds.</p>
	
    <br>	
	
	   <h3><b style="background-color:mediumseagreen; width:20px;"> 5.</b> Launch an online portfolio</h3>
	   <p style="font-size:15px; margin:20px;">Employers want to see results, such as current examples of successful site and application builds. With a portfolio,
	     developers can test new technologies and tools, as well as demonstrate their coding talent and technical capabilities.<b style="color:red;"> Standout portfolios can help candidates 
		 clear that crucial first hurdle: landing a job interview.</b></p>
		 
		 <br>
		 <p style="font-size:20px; margin:20px;">A website is like a plant that needs constant nurturing. Just when you think it’s perfect, you’ll find a glitch
		  that needs to be fixed or an element that the client wants added. Technology is constantly evolving so there will always be improvements to be made. 
		  Think of it this way: Even if someone created the “perfect” website in 2005, that site will still look very dated and could have several security or 
		  structural deficiencies in the back end when compared to the latest and greatest sites of today.</p>
